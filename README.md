## Hey I'm Daniela 👩‍💻👋, 🧗‍♀️⛷️🚵

I’m a full-stack developer based in Reno, Nevada, with several years of experience in the Ruby and JavaScript ecosystems. 

Recently, I co-created **🐿️ [Burrow](https://burrow-io.github.io/)**, an open-source data ingestion pipeline that streamlines RAG application development. 

I work extensively with AWS and Docker and have hands-on experience building systems in the AI space.

When I'm away from the computer, I am outside climbing and also enjoy skiing, mountain biking and just being in the mountains.
